##IntelliJ IDEA - Debugger (I)
* When writing a program, programmers usually run into three kinds of errors - syntax, runtime and logic errors.
* The syntax errors are caught by the IDE. They are very easy to find and fix.
* The logical errors are very difficult to find as the IDE does not recognize the fault in the logic. This is when using debugger in the IDE becomes extremely handy.
* Debugging features in IntelliJ IDE are comprehensive. Among all the features, the following will be discussed at length in the presentation.
    * Break points/ conditional breakpoints
    * Configuring the debugger
    * Inline Debugging
    * Exploring Frames
