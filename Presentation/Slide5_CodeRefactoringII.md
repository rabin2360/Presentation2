## IntelliJ IDEA - Code Refactoring (II)
* Change Method Signature: In IntelliJ, changing the method signature can be performed in various ways. Below are a few ways to change the method signature in IntelliJ:
    1. Change the method name and return type
    2. Change parameter names and re-order parameters
    3. Add new parameters

* The following picture shows the code before Change Method Signature refactoring is performed. Using IntelliJ, in the following code,
    1. the name of `oldMethodName` will be changed to `newMethodName`.
    2. the order of the parameters `(int parameter1, double parameter2)` will be changed to `(double parameter2, int parameter1)`.
    3. the return type of the method `oldMethodName` will be changed from `int` to `double`.
    4. the parameter mame will be changed from `parameter1` to `newParameter1` and `parameter2` to `newParameter2`. The default value of newParameter1 will stay 1 and newParameter2 will stay 0.
    5. a new parameter will be added by the name 'newParameter3' with a default value of 3.

* Before refactoring the sample code:

* Process of refactoring the sample code:
![How to refactor a method](https://github.com/rabin2360/Presentation2/blob/master/Presentation/processOfChangingMethodSignature.png)
* After refactoring the sample code:
![After refactoring](https://github.com/rabin2360/Presentation2/blob/master/Presentation/afterMethodRefactoring.png)

* As seen from the screen shot after performing the refactoring, based on the refactoring done in the method `newMethodName`, the call to `newMethodName` in method `anotherMethodName` in class `SecondClass` changes accordingly where
    1. the position of the default values are changed accordingly for all the parameters
    2. when adding a new parameter, the default value for the new parameter is added automatically on the function call

* Way(s) to change a method signature in IntelliJ:
    1. In the code editor, place the cursor within the name of the method whose signature is to be changed.
    2. Perform one of the following:
        * Press **Ctrl + F6**.
        * Choose **Refactor | Change Signature** from the context menu.
        * Choose **Refactor | Change Signature** in the main menu.
    3. In the Change Signature dialog box, change the method visibility scope, method name, return type, manage parameters, etc. as desired.
