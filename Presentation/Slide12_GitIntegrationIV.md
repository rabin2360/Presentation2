##IntelliJ IDEA - Git Integration (IV)
* Pushing files to a local/remote repository using IntelliJ IDE: When committing a change from IntelliJ IDE, users have the option of either pushing the change to the local repository or to the remote repository. IntelliJ supports both functionality.
* In order to commit the changes to the local repository or remote repository,
    * Open the Commit Changes dialog box by performing one of the following actions:
        * On the tool window toolbar, select Commit Changes.
        * On the main menu, select **VCS | Commit Changes**.
        * On the main menu, select **VCS | Git | Commit File**.
    * The Commit Changes dialog box for IntelliJ looks like below where it allows the user to specify the author, perform actions like reformatting the code, performing code analysis, check to-do list, etc. before making the code commit. The Commit Changes Dialog box also contains the option to amend a commit, which erases the previous commit and replaces it with the new commit being made. The Commit Changes Dialog box looks like below:
