## IntelliJ IDEA - Git Integration (I)
* IntelliJ IDEA has Git integration and allows the Git functions to be performed from the IDE itself. IntelliJ allows to either create a local Git repository or push the files in the local Git repository to be pushed to GitHub.
* If local Git repository is preferred, IntelliJ allows the user to either clone the repository from GitHub and use locally or create a completely new project that is version controlled by Git locally.
* Git also allows the project being held locally and version controlled by Git to be pushed to remote repositories like GitHub.
* However, in order to get started with Git in IntelliJ IDE, the Git executable has to be downloaded to the local machine.
* The following method walks through the steps of creating a local Git repository:
    * Open the project that needs to version controlled.
    * Navigate to **VCS | Import into Version Control | Create Git Repository**.
    * In the Dialog Box that opens, specify the directory where Git local repository is to be created.
    * As needed, track the files of the project that need versioning.
