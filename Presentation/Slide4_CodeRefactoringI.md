## IntelliJ IDEA - Code Refactoring (I)
* Refactoring allows the developers to change the written code without changing the behavior of the code. Usually the process of refactoring the code leads to a readable code which in turn makes maintaining and extending the existing code a simpler task.
* IntelliJ IDEA provides a wide variety of code refactorings. To name a few, below is the list:
    1. [Change Method Signature](Slide5_CodeRefactoringII.md)
    2. [Change Class Signature] (Slide6_CodeRefactoringIII.md)
    3. [Pull Members up or push members down] (Slide_CodeRefactoringIV.md)
    4. [Replace Inheritence with Delegation] (Slide_CodeRefactoringV.md)
