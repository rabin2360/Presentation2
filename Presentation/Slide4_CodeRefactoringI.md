## IntelliJ IDEA - Code Refactoring (I)
* Refactoring allows the developers to change the written code without changing the behavior of the code. Usually the process of refactoring the code leads to a readable code which in turn makes maintaining and extending the existing code a simpler task.
* IntelliJ IDEA provides a wide variety of code refactorings. To name a few, below is the list:
    1. Change Method Signature
    2. Change Class Signature
    3. Pull Members up or push members down
    4. Replace Inheritence with Delegation
