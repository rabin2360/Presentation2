## IntelliJ IDEA - Smart Code Completion
* IntelliJ allows the developer to be more productive by providing intelligent code completion. The intelligent code completion is supported for Java, Scala, Groovy, JavaScript, HTML, CSS amongst other programming languages.
* The code completion feature in IntelliJ helps the developers to complete names of classes, methods, fields and keywords that are within the visibility of the **current scope**. For instance,

 This boots the productivity of the developer.

## IntelliJ IDEA - On-the-fly Code Analysis
* IntelliJ performs static code analysis to determine places of probable bugs, locate dead code, improvide code structure and detect performance issues without executing the code being written. This makes it easier for developers to write the code and identify problems even before executing the code.
* For the following code
```
 boolean value = false;

        if(value == true)
        {
            System.out.println("This code will never be executed !");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("This statement will always be executed!");
```

On writing the code above, IntelliJ performs the static code analysis as follows:
